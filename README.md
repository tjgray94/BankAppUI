# BankAppUI
BankApp was created for users to be able to create bank accounts and manage their funds wherever and whenever needed. Users have the ability to sign up as a new customer and create a checking or savings account or even both. Once created, users can then sign in to view their account(s) and make a transaction whether it be a withdrawal or deposit. For users with multiple accounts, they have the ability to transfer funds between accounts. 

UI for this application was created using ReactJS
